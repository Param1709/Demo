            <h2>Planes</h2>
            <p>The first successful, powered, controlled, heavier-than-air airplane was the Wright Flyer, flown by the American
            brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright on December 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, marking the dawn of aviation.
            This historic flight, with Orville at the controls for the first attempt, launched a new era, though earlier gliders and
            brief powered hops by others existed, the Wrights achieved the first truly sustained flight.</p>

                    Altitude: Fly high (30,000-42,000 ft) for thinner, more efficient air, avoiding most weather.
                    Lightning: Struck yearly but designed to handle it safely.
                    Glide: Can glide for long distances even with engine failure.

        wingspan, 73m long), and luxurious cabin potential with space for bars or showers, accommodating 500+ passengers with
        quiet, smooth flights, built from millions of parts by global companies, and operated by airlines like Emirates for
        long-haul routes.</p>
